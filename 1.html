<h2>Short story</h2>

<p><b><i>Before Sunrise</i></b> is a 1995 American romantic drama film directed by Richard Linklater
  and written by Linklater and Kim Krizan. The film follows Jesse (Ethan Hawke),
  a young American man, and Céline (Julie Delpy), a young French woman,
  who meet on a train and disembark in Vienna, where they spend the night walking around the city and getting to know each other.
<br><br>The plot is considered minimalistic, as not much happens aside from walking and talking.
  The two characters' ideas and perspectives on life and love are detailed.
  Jesse is a romantic disguised as a cynic, and Céline is seemingly a romantic, albeit with some doubts.
  Taking place over the course of one night, their limited time together is always on their minds,
  and leads to their revealing more about themselves than they normally would,
  since both believe they will never see one another again.
  <br><br>Before Sunrise opened to a strongly positive reception from critics.
  Jesse and Céline later make an appearance in Linklater's 2001 film Waking Life.
  A 2004 sequel, Before Sunset, picks up the story nine years after the events of the first film,
  and a 2013 sequel, Before Midnight, picks up the story eighteen years on.</p>
