<h6>Linklater in 2015</h6>
<p>Before Sunrise was inspired by a woman whom writer/director <strong>Richard Linklater</strong> met in a toy shop in Philadelphia in 1989.
They walked around the city together, conversing deep into the night.
Originally, in the screenplay, who the two people were and the city they spend time in was vague.
Linklater realized that because the film is so much a dialogue between a man and a woman,
it was important to have a strong woman co-writer. He chose Kim Krizan, who had small roles
in his two previous films Slacker and Dazed and Confused.
According to Linklater, he "loved the way her mind worked
– a constant stream of confident and intelligent ideas".
<br><br>
Linklater and Krizan talked about the concept of the film and the characters for a long time.
He wanted to explore the "relationship side of life and discover two people who had complete anonymity
and try to find out who they really were".He decided to put Jesse and Céline in a foreign country
because "when you're traveling, you're much more open to experiences outside your usual realm".
He and Krizan worked on an outline. They wrote the actual screenplay in 11 days.
<br><br>
Linklater spent nine months casting the film because he saw so many people but had trouble finding the right actors
for the roles of <i>Jesse and Céline</i>.
When Linklater first considered casting Hawke,
he thought that the actor was too young for the part.
Linklater saw Hawke at a play in New York City and reconsidered after talking to the actor.
For Céline, Linklater met Julie Delpy and liked her personality. After they did a final reading,
Linklater knew that Delpy and Hawke were right for the roles.
Once Delpy and Hawke agreed to do the film, they went to Austin and talked with Linklater and Krizan for a few days.
In 2016, Delpy told Creative Screenwriting, "Ethan and I basically re-wrote all of it.
There was an original screenplay, but it wasn’t very romantic, believe it or not.
It was just a lot of talking, rather than romance.
Richard hired us because he knew we were writing and he wanted us to bring that romance to the film.
We brought those romantic ideas and that’s how I wrote something that actually got made, without really getting credit for it.
But, if I had written Before Sunrise and been credited, then I doubt it would have been financed.".
Though Delpy and Hawke were not credited with writing this film, they received credit for co-writing the sequels.</p>
